# Neural-Network-Challenge-1
# Project Description
Part 1: Data Preparation for Neural Network Model The data was preprocessed using Pandas and scikit-learnâ€™s StandardScaler() to prepare it for building and evaluating the neural network model.

Part 2: Model Compilation and Evaluation with a Neural Network A deep neural network model was designed using TensorFlow to predict a student's credit quality based on dataset features. This process involved:

Deciding on the number of inputs, layers, and neurons per layer
Compiling and fitting the model
Evaluating the model's performance, including calculating its loss and accuracy
Saving the model for future use
Part 3: Predicting Loan Repayment Success with the Neural Network Model Using the saved model, predictions were generated on reserved testing data to assess loan repayment success.

Part 4: Key Components for Building a Student Loan Recommendation System To give a well-rounded view of a student's financial and academic profile, essential data would include student demographics (age, education, GPA, field of study), financial details (income, aid received), loan history, credit score, and location. The system would use context-based filtering, which accounts for personal and situational factors, offering advantages over collaborative or content-based filtering approaches. Key challenges include maintaining data privacy and security, especially with sensitive financial information, and addressing potential biases to avoid discrimination against students from marginalized backgrounds.

All of the code is written by me and I used the help of my class notes for my code.
